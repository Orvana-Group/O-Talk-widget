<h2>ðŸš€ Start Chatting</h2>
<p>
  The process for integrating our chatbot on your page is currently being
  structured. Hereâ€™s a preview of the expected steps:
</p>

<h3>1. Include O-Talk Script</h3>
<p>
  The setup will likely involve adding a script snippet to your website's
  <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> or just before the closing
  <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script src="https://o-talk.com/chatbot.js" DATA_USER_ID='your_unique_id'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<h3>2. Initialize the Chatbot</h3>
<p>
  To activate the chatbot, the initialization step will require a script similar
  to:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
      OTalk.init({
        botId: 'YOUR_BOT_ID',
        themeColor: '#ff6347', // Customize with your preferred color
        position: 'bottom-right', // Options: 'bottom-right', 'bottom-left', etc.
        welcomeMessage: 'Hi! How can I help you today?',
      });
    &lt;/script&gt;
    </code></pre>

<h3>3. Customize the Chatbot (Optional)</h3>
<p>
  We are also considering offering customization options, allowing you to
  personalize the chatbotâ€™s appearance and behavior:
</p>
<pre><code>OTalk.init({
      botId: 'YOUR_BOT_ID',
      themeColor: '#123456', // Match your brand colors
      position: 'bottom-right', 
      welcomeMessage: 'Hello! How can we assist you?',
      language: 'en', // Potentially supporting 'en', 'es', 'fr', etc.
      autoOpen: false, // You may have the option to auto-open the chat on page load
    });
    </code></pre>

<p>
  These steps and configurations are still being planned, and detailed
  instructions will be provided once everything is finalized.
</p>
